                    other schools, with such hardworking team we show others how fast we are. I had great memories during the XC season!</td>

                <td style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 20px">Not just plain running I was interested in but I took a further step during middle school and now to do triathalons. I felt like adding the sport of swimming and biking would add in fun expirience. A triathalon is a process of swimming,
                    biking, and running in that order for certain distances. To me stamina based sports is a way to push my self and see how far I can go, that's why I tried out triathalons.</td>

                <td style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 20px">Why I run? It's because of Eluid Kipchoge and his techniques of running that inspire me. He's a person I look up to in terms of running. His acheivement's have broken distance records in the Olympics and has the time for the fastest marathon
                    which he finished in a shocking sub 2 hours!</td>

            <td style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 20px">Besides running a marathon in the future. I hope to do a Iron Man which is a triathlon containing 3.1 miles of swim, 100 miles of bike, and 26.2 miles of run with no stops. It may seem painful but to me it's a challenge and hope to do it when
                I'm older. </td>
