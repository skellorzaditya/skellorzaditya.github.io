            <h2>Who am I?</h2>

            <h2>When I moved out!</h2>
            <p>There was a family of 4 walking towards me I was so excited. At this time I was in a box with my other pals. I just stood there as a hand reached out to me. So, I decided why no I give them a shakehand. For some reason they were so hyped when
                I touched the persons hand, but it got me excited. After an hour I left my box on to my new home.</p>

            <h2>Jumped Out the House</h2>
            <p>I was so confused, they let me outside into the backyard so I ran around and around. I was bored, went under the fence into the bigger yard. It's the biggest yard I've seen and for some reason my caretaker got so mad and worried. I didn't
                car, I was zooming out on the grass. Somone hopped over the fence and tried to get me with a treat in his hand. So, I started playing with him till he got chased me around and got me.</p>

            <h2>Life Style</h2>
            <p>I wake up as the two little kids go to school. Go to the bigger people's bed and sleep for a while till the sun rises more. In the afternoon I eat my lunch ans sleep on the couch. Around 4:30 p.m two small kids come back from were ever they
                went. This is the time where I play till they go back to there rooms and do somehting. During dinner it gets boring sometimes they play and ohter times there still either outside or in there rooms. I hope theres one day I will freely rome
                roam around.</p>
